# Financial freedom through investing

Money for Something will teach you the one approach to investing that has reliably worked for generations. In less than an hour, you’ll have all the information you need—including details of my own portfolio—to start down the path to financial freedom, today.

In addition to the book, this website also includes information [about myself](/about/), some useful [resources](#resources), a [blog](/blog/), and a [contact form](/contact/), if you’d like to say hello.

With that, let’s jump right in.
