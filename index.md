# Investing can change your life

Investing changed my life, and can change yours too—you just need to know what to do. Unfortunately, a whole industry exists to sell you products and methods that don’t work. Just getting through all that, to the method that actually does work, is a challenge.
Complicating the problem, mainstream investment books are mostly written by investors, not educators, and often derail understanding of the simple but critical basics, by introducing less important complexities. 

I set out to solve this problem, by creating Money for Something—a book that can be read in an hour, and teaches everything you need to start down the reliable path to financial freedom.

Best of all, it’s free! I hope you enjoy it, and help me spread the word.
