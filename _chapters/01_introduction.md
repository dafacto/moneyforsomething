When I was 15, I got my first job at a grocery store. Working long hours for little pay, I often wondered whether the choice of how I spend my time would forever be tied to the need to earn money.

The few wealthy people I knew either inherited their money, or had started successful companies. Most of the business owners told me that, in all honesty, a lot of luck was involved.

Hoping not to rely on luck, I began reading books about investing, and what I discovered couldn’t have been more exciting—*that with enough time, practically anyone can achieve financial freedom*. 

I put the principles into practice, and over the next 20 years confirmed that they work!

It’s profoundly important to know that the path to financial freedom is so accessible—just by following a set of basic principles, with discipline. At the same time, it’s tragic that so many never get there, simply due to lack of knowledge.

**That’s why I wrote this guide.**

The problem with most investing books is that they are too long and complex. The basic message that *everyone should be investing* gets lost in discussion of non-essential complexities. My approach here is to present the core principles as concisely as possible—and in the process motivate and convince you to start investing today.
