Through this book,  I hope I’ve motivated you, wherever you live, to take action and start a program of personal investment today. It could be one of the most important decisions you ever make—it certainly was for me! 

If you’ve gotten any value from the book, the one thing I ask is that you **share it with someone**, perhaps by email or a post on social media. Given the life-changing potential of long-term investing, even for those with modest incomes, it’s nearly tragic that these principles aren’t taught to young people in schools. So it’s up to us—you and I—to spread the word!

Finally, if you have questions, or just want to say hello, [I’d love to hear from you](/contact/).

Good luck, and I wish you the best!
