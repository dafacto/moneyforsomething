**Compounding returns** is the notion of *earning money on past earnings*. If this is new to you, pay attention—this will be the most important chapter of the book.

Let’s walk through an example:

- Say you have $100 in savings, earning 4% per year. After the first year, you’ll have $104—your original $100, plus $4 of earnings. Makes sense, right?

- After the second year you’ll have $108.16—another $4 earned on your original $100 savings, plus $0.16 earned on last year’s earnings of $4.

- After the third year, $112.49—another $4 on your original $100, plus $0.33 on your last two years earnings of $8.16.

*Earnings on earnings, year after year.* 

It’s hard to believe such a simple concept could be so important. But after many years of investing, *the majority of your savings will have come from compound returns*, rather than original investments.

Consider this example:

Stephanie is 25, and earns $50,000. Her salary increases each year with inflation. If she saves just 10% of her income, and earns an 8% annual return, then at age 55 she will have *invested* $280,000, but will have accumulated *nearly one million dollars*!

The above chart highlights some important concepts.

- **The power of compounding returns** — After 30 years, far more of her final balance of $920,000 comes from earnings ($640,000), than from the money she actually saved ($280,000). Earnings on earnings.

- **The importance of time** — The power of compounding returns comes late in the game. Had she waited five years to start saving—delaying her start by 16%—her final balance after 25 years would have been reduced by 40% ($565,000 compared to $920,000).

- **The importance of the annual rate of return** — What if Stephanie had just put her money in the bank, earning 3% per year? Her final balance would be $420,000—i.e. decreasing her annual return from 8% to 3% decreases her final balance by more than half!
