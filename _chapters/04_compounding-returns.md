**Compounding returns** is simply *earning money on past earnings*, and is the most important concept in this book. It’s what turns small saving, into large amounts of money.

Let’s walk through an example:

- Say you have $100 in savings, earning 4% per year. After the first year, you’ll have $104—i.e. your original $100, plus $4 of earnings. Makes sense, right?

- After the second year you’ll have $108.16—i.e. another $4 earned on your original $100 savings, plus $0.16 earned on last year’s earnings of $4.

- After the third year, $112.49—i.e. another $4 on your original $100, plus $0.33 on your last two years earnings of $8.16.

*Earnings on earnings, year after year. Compound returns.* 

It’s hard to believe such a simple concept could be so important. But after many years of investing, *the majority of your savings will have come from compound returns*, rather than original investments.

Consider this example:

Stephanie is 25, and has a salary of $50,000. Her pay increases yearly with inflation. If she saves just 10% of her income, and earns an 8% annual return, then at age 55 she will have *invested* $280,000, but will have accumulated *nearly one million dollars*!

It’s super important to understand the concepts in this chart:

- **The power of compounding returns** — After 30 years, far more of her final balance of $920,000 comes from earnings ($640,000), than from the money she actually saved ($280,000). Earnings on earnings. Compound returns.

- **The importance of time** — The power of compounding returns comes late in the game. Waiting just five years to start, would have reduced her final balance by *40%* ($565,000 compared to $920,000).

- **The importance of the annual rate of return** — What if Stephanie had just put her money in the bank, earning 3% per year? Her final balance would be $420,000—i.e. decreasing her annual return from 8% to 3% decreases her final balance by more than half!
