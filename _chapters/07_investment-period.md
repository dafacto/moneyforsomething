The first way to reduce investment risk is to hold your investments for a long time. Let’s look at a graph of what happens when we hold stocks for different periods of time.

What does this chart tell us?

- During the 55-year period between 1950 and 2005, if we had held stocks for any particular *one-year period*, we could have gained as much as 50%, or we could have lost nearly 30%. Ouch—holding stocks for just one year seems risky!

- When held for any *5-year period* during those 55 years, the annualized return would have been somewhere between about +29% and −2%. That sounds a little better.

- Looking further, we see that stocks held for any *10-year period* during those 55 years would have never lost money.

- But held for any *20-year period* during those 55 years, the annualized return would have fallen somewhere between 7% and 18%. Nice!
