The first way to reduce investment risk is to hold your investments for a long time. Let’s look at a graph of what happens when we hold stocks for different periods of time.

During the 55-year period between 1950 and 2005, if we had held stocks for any particular year, we could have gained as much as 50%, or we could have lost nearly 30%. Ouch—holding stocks for just one year seems risky!

When held for any 5-year period during those 55 years, the annualized return would have been somewhere between about +29% and −2%. That sounds a little better.
Looking further, we see that stocks held for any 10-year period during those 55 years would have never lost money.

And held for any 20-year period during those 55 years, the annualized return would have fallen somewhere between 7% and 18%. Nice!
