Holding volatile investments, like stocks,   over a long period of time reduces the risk of losing money. Let’s look at a graph of what happens when we hold stocks for different periods of time.

What does this chart tell us?

- During the 55-year period between 1950 and 2005, if we had held stocks for any particular *one-year period*, we could have gained as much as 50%, or we could have lost nearly 30%. Ouch—holding stocks for just one year seems risky!

- When held for any *5-year period* during those 55 years, the annualized return would have been somewhere between about +29% and −2%. That sounds a little better.

- Looking further, we see that stocks held for any *10-year period* during those 55 years would have never lost money.

- But held for any *20-year period* during those 55 years, the *minimum* annualized return we would have earned would be 7%, and the maximum, 18%. Now we’re talking!
