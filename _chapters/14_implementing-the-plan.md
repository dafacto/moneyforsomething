We’re now ready to invest! How do we get started? It’s easy—the strategy outlined in this guide can be fully implemented through a common online brokerage account.

If you’re in the United States, there’s no shortage of good-quality, online, discount brokerages available — including Charles Schwab, Vanguard, E*Trade, Ameritrade, and Scottrade, just to name a few. If you’re outside the United States, discount brokerages are less common. At our website, we’ll try to maintain an up-to-date list of options for many countries.

Most brokerages allow you to create an account online. Once your account is setup, you then fund it by making bank transfers, or sending a check. Once funded, you can buy and sell securities which trade on the various stock markets. As you know by now, we’ll be using the brokerage to buy and sell ETFs. Buying is literally as simple as entering the ETF symbol and number of shares you want to buy, and clicking the “Buy” button.

## Which ETFs should I purchase?

Earlier, we suggested two conservative asset allocations. The following is a list of specific ETFs you can buy to implement those allocations. (Remember, we provide additional options in the resources section.)

### Option 1: The classic

This allocation involves buying three ETFs, with a total annual cost of 0.16%.

| Investment Product                        | Symbol | Allocation | Cost  |
|-------------------------------------------|--------|------------|-------|
| {{ site.data.etfs.vti.name }} | [{{ site.data.etfs.vti.symbol }}]({{ site.data.etfs.vti.url }}) | 25% | {{ site.data.etfs.vti.cost }} |
| {{ site.data.etfs.vxus.name }} | [{{ site.data.etfs.vxus.symbol }}]({{ site.data.etfs.vxus.url }}) | 25% | {{ site.data.etfs.vxus.cost }} |
| {{ site.data.etfs.bnd.name }} | [{{ site.data.etfs.bnd.symbol }}]({{ site.data.etfs.bnd.url }}) | 50% | {{ site.data.etfs.bnd.cost }} |

### Option 2: What I do

The allocation in which I personally invest involves buying five ETFs, with a total annual cost of 0.20%.



| Investment Product                    | Symbol | Allocation | Cost  |
|---------------------------------------|--------|------------|-------|
| {{ site.data.etfs.vv.name }} | [{{ site.data.etfs.vv.symbol }}]({{ site.data.etfs.vv.url }}) | 20% | {{ site.data.etfs.vv.cost }} |
| {{ site.data.etfs.vbr.name }} | [{{ site.data.etfs.vbr.symbol }}]({{ site.data.etfs.vbr.url }}) | 20% | {{ site.data.etfs.vbr.cost }} |
| {{ site.data.etfs.tlt.name }} | [{{ site.data.etfs.tlt.symbol }}]({{ site.data.etfs.tlt.url }}) | 20% | {{ site.data.etfs.tlt.cost }} |
| {{ site.data.etfs.iau.name }} | [{{ site.data.etfs.iau.symbol }}]({{ site.data.etfs.iau.url }}) | 20% | {{ site.data.etfs.iau.cost }} |
| {{ site.data.etfs.shv.name }} | [{{ site.data.etfs.shv.symbol }}]({{ site.data.etfs.shv.url }}) | 20% | {{ site.data.etfs.shv.cost }} |


## Why these particular ETFs?

I’ve suggested ETFs issued primarily by Vanguard and iShares for two reasons. First, they are among the largest issuers, which in itself provides for some security. At present, over $21 billion are invested in Vanguard’s VTI ETF. Secondly, they are among the cheapest; for example, the Vanguard VTI ETF costs only 0.07% per year.

## What if you live outside the United States?

There are three considerations—currency, the stock exchange and estate taxes.

### 1. Currency

This guide focuses on principles that are objective, universal and time-tested. Currency selection can be a matter of opinion, so I’ll just tell you my personal thoughts, relevant to my four-component Permanent Portfolio asset allocation.

An investment in global stocks—such as the combination of the VTI and VXUS ETFs—is an investment in all currencies. Gold is currency agnostic. So the components of my portfolio which are currency-specific are United States government long-term bonds, and cash.
In the Permanent Portfolio, the bonds provide protection during deflation, and for that, it’s critical they can’t be called or default. At the moment, there isn’t a more secure long-term bond than that issued by the United States government.

My cash is split between US Dollars and the Euro, because those are the two currencies I use to buy things.

### 2. Stock exchange

The second issue relevant to those living outside the United States is the stock exchange on which your ETFs are bought and sold.

All of the ETFs recommended above are bought and sold on the American stock exchanges. The iShares company also issues ETFs for sale on foreign exchanges. For example, the iShares World ETF, IWRD—which would be comparable to the *combination* of the Vanguard VTI and VXUS ETFs—is bought and sold on several European exchanges.

A brokerage in Spain will likely apply a lower transaction charge for ETFs sold on the Madrid exchange, as opposed to ETFs sold on the American exchange. In the case of the Spanish Renta4 brokerage, they presently charge 1.50€ to buy ETFs sold on the Madrid exchange (like IWRD), but 0.15% for ETFs purchased on the American exchanges.

The IWRD ETF has an annual management fee of 0.5%. The annual cost of the combination of VTI and VXUS is 0.125%. The long-term effect of the difference in annual cost can be greater than the long-term effect of the one-time 0.15% purchase fee, and for that reason, even with my European brokerage account, I still buy the American-listed ETFs.

### 3. Estate taxes

The final issue relevant to those living outside the United States is estate taxes. When a non-US person dies, the United States will charge up to 40% estate tax on any assets owned by the deceased which are considered to be “situated” in the United States. Imagine you owned a US-based brokerage account, in which you invested in ETFs sold by US-based Vanguard, but which invested exclusively in non-US companies. Would your investments be considered “US situated”?

Turns out the answer is yes; the determining factor is the location of the ETF itself—which in this case is the United States—and not the securities owned by the ETF.
A non-US person wishing to avoid US estate tax on their investments should therefore invest in non-US-listed ETFs. Fortunately, one of the largest ETF companies, iShares, has an ample range of ETF listed in Ireland, which can be purchased on most European exchanges. A sample portfolio based on non-US listed ETFs can be found at the book website, moneyforsomething.org.

## The step-by-step process

Here’s how you implement the plan:

1. Open an account at a discount brokerage.
2. Buy the individual ETFs corresponding to the asset allocation you’ve chosen.
3. Save as much as you can each month, purchasing additional shares of those ETFs.
4. Periodically check whether your allocation needs rebalancing, and if so, buy and/or sell the shares necessary to bring it back to its target.

**Simple. Easy. Powerful.**
