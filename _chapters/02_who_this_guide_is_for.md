Time is an essential ingredient in achieving financial freedom through the approach described in this guide. For that reason, this guide will be particularly relevant to those in their 20s, 30s and early 40s—i.e. those with enough time to experience the power of compounding returns (something we’ll learn about later).

At the same time, savings kept in a bank account will lose value (purchasing power) over time, due to the effects of inflation. The approach discussed in this guide has historically provided a return above inflation. Anyone, at any age, should be interested in at least preserving the value of their savings, and should therefore find valuable information in Money for Something.
