Time is an essential ingredient in achieving financial freedom through personal investment. For that reason, this guide will be particularly relevant to those in their 20s, 30s and early 40sâ€”i.e. those with enough time to grow their investments while still at a relatively young age.

On the other hand, savings kept in a bank account will lose value (purchasing power) over time, due to the effects of inflation. The investment approach discussed in this guide has historically provided a return above inflation. Anyone, at any age, should be interested in at least preserving the value of their savings, and should therefore find valuable information in this guide.
