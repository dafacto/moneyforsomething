Time is an essential ingredient in achieving financial freedom through the investing approach described in this book.

For that reason, this book will be particularly relevant to those younger than 40—i.e. those with enough time to benefit from the power of compounding returns.

At the same time, inflation erodes the value of savings kept in a bank account, and the investing approach taught here has historically provided a return above inflation. 

Regardless of age, *everyone* should be interested in at least preserving the value of their savings, and can therefore benefit from the information in Money for Something.
