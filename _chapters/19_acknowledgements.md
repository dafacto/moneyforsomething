I’d like to thank my colleagues at Makalu, Alex Bendiken and Justin Driscoll, for their collaboration. I’d also like to thank a number of individuals who graciously volunteered their time to read and provide feedback on draft versions of the book: Philip Guo, David Heinemeier Hansson, Justin Miller, Mike Rohde, Craig Rowland, Andy Rutledge, Ryan Singer, Derek Sivers, Michael Tsai, and my loving mother, Jean Henderson.
