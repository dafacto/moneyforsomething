  description: It would be difficult to overstate how good this podcast is, going all the way back to 2006, including interviews with the likes of Milton Friedman. If I could only listen to one podcast, this would be it.

  description: Another of my favorite podcasts. While Patrick is the founder of an active management company, which isn't quite consistent with the approach described in my book, he has an extraordinarily good podcast, covering topics related to hedge funds, machine learning in investing and crypto currencies.
