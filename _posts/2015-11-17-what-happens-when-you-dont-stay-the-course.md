In my book, Money for Something we discuss how important it is to "stay the course." Most people, however, don't stay the course, and this chart from the J.P. Morgan [Guide to the Markets][2] illustrates the astounding consequences.

> Truly incredible—During the 20 years between 1993 and 2012, the annualized returns of the asset classes in which we typical invest varied between <strong>6.3%</strong> and <strong>11.2%</strong>. But the return actually realized by the average investor was a meager <strong>2.3%</strong>—not even beating inflation.

Why does this happen? The reasons are many:

* <strong>Investors often pay high fees.</strong> A mutual fund charging 2.5% will <em>cut your long-term returns in half</em>. Terrible, especially when you consider there are ultra low-cost alternatives available, from companies like Vanguard, which have fees as low as 0.05%.

* <strong>Investors make emotional decisions.</strong> So many investors exit the market during crashes. A successful investor doesn't panic during crashes, nor does he become euphoric during bull markets. With discipline and without emotion, he just continues with his strategy.

* <strong>Investors chase performance.</strong> Investors are constantly jumping from one strategy to another, from one fund to another, always chasing last-years winners—which, in the long-run, is a losing strategy.

Long-term investing as described in Money for Something has reliably proved successful for generations, but you have to have discipline, and you have to stay the course.
