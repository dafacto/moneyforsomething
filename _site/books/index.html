<p><strong>The Millionaire Next Door</strong><br />
Thomas Stanley</p>

<p>Over a decade of research revealed some eye-opening data about who are the millionaires among us. Although this book isn’t about investing, it reveals the personal characteristics you’ll want to adopt to give you the best chances possible to become wealthy through investing, and keep it.</p>

<p><strong>The Random Walk Guide to Investing</strong><br />
Burton G. Malkiel</p>

<p>Burton Malkiel is a professor of economics at Princton University, and a leading finance author. The Random Walk Guide to Investing is a simplified version of his more in-depth book, A Random Walk Down Wall Street. If I could only recommend one book, it would be this one.</p>

<p><strong>The Investor’s Manifesto</strong><br />
William J. Bernstein</p>

<p>William Bernstein is financial theorist known for his research in the field of modern portfolio theory. He’s also a leading finance author, whose in-depth books we recommend below. The Investor’s Manifesto was his approachable primer to investing.</p>

<p><strong>Rational Expectations</strong><br />
William J. Bernstein</p>

<p>Bernstein’s latest, and perhaps my favorite, book about asset allocation. Continuing the theme of his “Investing for Adults” series, this full-length finance title is not for beginners, but rather assumes a fair degree of quantitative ability and finance knowledge.</p>

<p><strong>Fail-safe Investing</strong><br />
Harry Browne</p>

<p>The late Harry Browne designed one of the simplest, yet profoundly sophisticated asset allocations, based on the four states of the economy. This book is a masterpiece.</p>

<p><strong>The Permanent Portfolio</strong><br />
Craig Rowland &amp; Mike Lawson</p>

<p>This 2012 book extends on Harry Browne’s classic, with information about the modern implementation of the Permanent Portfolio, and even delves into extended topics relevant to international investors, and foreign gold holdings.</p>
