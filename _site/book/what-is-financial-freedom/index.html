    <h1 class="post-title">What is financial freedom?</h1>
    
    <p>Since this book is about <strong>financial freedom</strong>, it’s important to understand exactly what that means, and what this guide offers in helping you get there.</p>

<h2 id="the-25-times-rule">The “25 times” rule</h2>

<p>There’s a rule of thumb which says that if you annually withdraw no more than 4% of your invested savings, chances are you will never run out of money. Viewed another way—<em>once you’ve saved 25 times your annual expenses, you are financially free</em>.</p>

<p>Say you want to stop working, and you need $120,000 per year to cover your expenses. In this case you’d need to save $3 million to achieve financial freedom. Say you could live on $40,000 per year. In that case, you’d only need $1 million. Or say you would like to change careers and $10,000 of annual income would give you the cushion to do that, then you’d need $250,000 to achieve financial freedom.</p>

<h2 id="it-worked-for-me">It worked for me</h2>

<p>At age 20, I began saving and investing a large portion of my earnings; income initially from a job at a grocery store, later from a job at a restaurant, and finally from my first job as an engineer.</p>

<p>Over the course of 15 years, my investments earned an annualized return of 11%. At age 35, those investments had grown enough to provided the freedom I needed to quit my job and finance a new business—which ultimately allowed me to live where I wanted and do the work I love.</p>

<h2 id="it-all-starts-with-saving">It all starts with saving</h2>

<p>For most people, like myself, achieving financial freedom requires the consistent saving of a large portion of their income, coupled with the growth that can be realized through investing.</p>

<p>If you commit to saving, the following chapters will teach you about investing, including concepts which are powerful enough to turn even modest savings into surprisingly large amounts of money.</p>

<p><strong>But it all starts with regular savings, and the potential for your own success will ultimately be related to the amount and consistency with which you can save.</strong></p>
