    <p>The first way to reduce investment risk is to hold your investments for a long time. Let’s look at a graph of what happens when we hold stocks for different periods of time.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/chart-07.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>What does this chart tell us?</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>During the 55-year period between 1950 and 2005, if we had held stocks for any particular <em>one-year period</em>, we could have gained as much as 50%, or we could have lost nearly 30%. Ouch—holding stocks for just one year seems risky!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When held for any <em>5-year period</em> during those 55 years, the annualized return would have been somewhere between about +29% and −2%. That sounds a little better.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Looking further, we see that stocks held for any <em>10-year period</em> during those 55 years would have never lost money.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But held for any <em>20-year period</em> during those 55 years, the annualized return would have fallen somewhere between 7% and 18%. Nice!</p>
  </li>
</ul>
