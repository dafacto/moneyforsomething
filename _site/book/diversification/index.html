    <h1 class="post-title">Diversification</h1>
    
    <p>The second important concept related to risk reduction is that of <strong>diversification</strong>. By mixing our investments among asset classes that are not related to each other—i.e. diversifying our investments—we can both <em>increase overall return while decreasing risk</em>.</p>

<h2 id="a-coin-toss-example">A coin toss example</h2>

<p>A great example of this principle is borrowed from William Bernstein’s book, “The intelligent asset allocator”.</p>

<p>Imagine someone offers you two investment options.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Option 1 involves flipping a coin at the end of each year. Heads—your total savings are increased by 30%; Tails—your savings are decreased by 10%.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Option 2 splits your balance in half at the end of each year, and then applies the same coin toss transaction individually to each half.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Would you say Option 2 is better or worse than Option 1? It might seem they would be the same.</p>

<p>Without going into the math, the annualized return, over time, of Option 1 is 8.2%, and the risk—the standard deviation—is 20%. The annualized return of Option 2 is 9.1%, an increase of nearly 1% over Option 1, and the risk is only 14%.</p>

<p><em>By simply going with two coin tosses, we increase return and reduce risk.</em> That’s the benefit of diversification!</p>

<h2 id="correlation">Correlation</h2>

<p>The diversification benefits provided by Option 2 are due to the fact that the two coin tosses are unrelated, or <em>uncorrelated</em>—i.e. the chance of getting heads on coin toss 2, is unrelated to what happened with coin toss 1.</p>

<p>This important concept has a number of implications. For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Buying the shares of 1000 companies in the stocks asset class provides more diversification benefit than buying shares in a single company.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Splitting your investments across relatively uncorrelated asset classes like stocks and bonds provides more diversification than splitting them among stocks of large companies and stocks of small companies.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In this guide, we recommend distributing your investments across multiple asset classes that are as uncorrelated as possible, in order to achieve diversification benefits.</p>

<p>An interesting consequence is that, at all times, <em>some of your investments should be doing good while others should be doing bad</em>, and that behavior is actually beneficial in the long run!</p>
