<p>My name is Matt Henderson, and I grew up in Georgia and studied electrical engineering in Atlanta at the Georgia Institute of Technology. With an interest in Europe—and a Spanish girlfriend—I finished my studies at Georgia Tech’s campus in France.</p>

<p>I started my career at the European Space Agency in Germany, where I founded an engineering company called Makalu Aerospace that was later sold to a public company in the United Kingdom. After moving to Spain, I started an American company called Makalu Interactive that has designed and built products for brands like Google and Virgin America.</p>

<p>Today I live on the Mediterranean sea, enjoying the warm climate, friendly people and amazing diversity of Andalucia. Starting my own companies was possible due to the investment principles I learned over two decades ago. Those same principles are available to anyone, and are what I teach in this new book. I hope you enjoy Money for Something!</p>

<p>I maintain a personal website at dafacto.com, and I’d love for you to follow me on Twitter.</p>
