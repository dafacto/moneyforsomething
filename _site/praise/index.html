<p>Brilliant clear-headed quick explanation of everything a non-investor needs to know. Don’t delay getting this book, and doing what it says. It will only take you an hour to read, and an hour to put into action. Then you’ll be making passive investments, instead of saying “someday…”</p>

<p><strong>David Heinemeier Hansson</strong><br />
Founder at Basecamp &amp; author of REWORK, REMOTE &amp; It Doesn’t Have to be Crazy at Work</p>

<p>Investing isn’t rocket science, despite what the alchemists of the financial industry would like you to believe. Matt shows you in simple steps how to build a no-frills portfolio using basic concepts anyone can understand. You’ll learn how to side-step the fees, stop acting like a day trader, and reap the power of compound interest. Get to it.</p>
